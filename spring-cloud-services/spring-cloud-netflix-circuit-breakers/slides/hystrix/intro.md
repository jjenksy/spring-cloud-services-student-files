## Hystrix - Defend Your App

![Hystrix](slides/resources/images/hystrix-logo.png "Hystrix") <!-- .element: style="max-width:50%" -->

Hystrix is designed to do the following:

* Give protection from and control over latency and failure from dependencies accessed (typically over the network) via third-party client libraries.

* Stop cascading failures in a complex distributed system.

* Fail fast and rapidly recover.

* Fallback and gracefully degrade when possible.

* Enable near real-time monitoring, alerting, and operational control.
