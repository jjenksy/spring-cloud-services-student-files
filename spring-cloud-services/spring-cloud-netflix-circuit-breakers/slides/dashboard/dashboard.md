When Netflix began to use this dashboard, their operations improved by reducing the time needed to discover and recover from operational events.

The duration of most production incidents (already less frequent due to Hystrix) became far shorter, with diminished impact, due to the real-time insights into system behavior provided by the Hystrix Dashboard.
