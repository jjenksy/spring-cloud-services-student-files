![Sand Castle](slides/resources/images/beach.jpg "Sand Castle") <!-- .element: style="border:1px solid black;" -->
* Resources are ephemeral
* Twelve Factor Patterns
  * e.g. Stateless Applications - Moving state outside of the application (session state, caches, user data)

- Downstream impact on design.  12 Factor design
