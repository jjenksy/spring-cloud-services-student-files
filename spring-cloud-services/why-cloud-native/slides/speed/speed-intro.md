Note:

It is well known that speed wins in the marketplace.  The ability to out pace your competition and bring solutions to market provides a competitive advantage.

However, Uber didn't crank out fleets of taxi cabs.  Netflix didn't open brick and mortar stores. And Airbnb did't open hotels.

What all these companies did do was embrace software as the way to disrupt these established industries and bring solutions to market much faster.

But they didn't do by leveraging enterprise solutions of the client-server era.  Their success is founded on leveraging cloud native architectures and based on principles of the cloud era and agile delivery.
