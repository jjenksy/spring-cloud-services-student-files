Note:

Consumer grade companies like Github have a culture of continuous delivery.  

Meaning that they have the option to deploy to production at anytime, but have put in the the proper precautions to do so.  More on that when we talk about safety.

On their busiest day in 2012, Aug. 23, saw 563 builds and 175 deploys

This why we are seeing the move to micro-services, to reduce the coupling and reduce the risk.
