## Visibility

Measure everything, establish profiles for what is normal.

Use modern monitoring and operational tools.


Note:

Architectures must provide the tools to identify failure when it is happening.

Examples include log aggregation tools like the ELK stack (Elastic Search, Logstash and Kibana) or Hystrix Dashboards and other visualization tools.
